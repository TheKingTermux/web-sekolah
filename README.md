# Login-System 

I've updated the login-System more security.
1) allow multiple user login
2) get user password as hash password
3) check user for the verification status


A simple Login System:

User can register an account, before login user need to verify his/her account. user will received a OTP code send by PHPMailer.

User can reset his/her password, user will received a new url link send by PHPMailer to reset his/her new password.
